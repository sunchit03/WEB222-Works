        <h2>What is Java?</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language and is designed to have a few
          implementation dependencies as possible. A general-purpose programming language made for
          developers to write once run anywhere that is compiled, Java code can run on all platforms
          that support Java. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any
          <abbr title="Java Virtual Machine">JVM</abbr>. The syntax of Java is similar to C/C++.

        <h2>History of Java</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Java was developed by a team of Sun Microsystems Inc. engineers known as the
          <strong>Green Team</strong> consisting of James Gosling, Mike Sheridan and Patrick
          Naughton in the year 1991. Later, it was acquired by the Oracle Corporation.
          <br />
          Java is the name of an island in Indonesia where the first coffee (named Java coffee) was
          produced. And this name was chosen by James Gosling while having coffee near his office.

        <h2>Java Terminology</h2>
        <hr />
        <p id="JVM">
          <abbr title="Java Virtual Machine"><strong>JVM</strong></abbr>
          : There are three execution phases of a program. These are : writing, compiling and
          running the program. The function of JVM is to execute the bytecode produced by the
          compiler.
        </p>
        <p id="bytecode">
          <strong>Byte Code</strong> : The javac compiler of JDK compiles the Java source code into
          bytecode so that it can be executed by JVM. It is saved as .class file by the computer. To
          view the bytecode, a dissembler like javap can be used.
        </p>
        <p id="JDK">
          <abbr title="Java Development Kit"><strong>JDK</strong></abbr>
          : It is a complete Java development kit that includes everything including compiler, Java
          Runtime Environment (JRE), Java debuggers, Java docs, etc. For the program to execute in
          Java, we need to install JDK on our computer in order to create, compile and run the Java
          program.
        </p>
        <p id="JRE">
          <abbr title="Java Runtime Environment"><strong>JRE</strong></abbr>
          : JDK includes JRE. JRE installation on our computer allows the Java program to run,
          however, we cannot compile it. JRE includes a browser, JVM, applet supports and plugins.
          For running the Java program, a computer needs JRE.
        </p>
        <p id="garbage">
          <strong>Garbage Collection</strong> : Java garbage collection is an automatic process
          which involves looking at heap memory, identifying which objects are in use and which are
          not, and deleting the unused objects.
        </p>
        <p id="classpath">
          <strong>Class Path</strong> : It is the file path where the Java runtime and Java compiler
          look for .class files to load. By default, JDK provides many libraries. If you want to
          include external libraries, they should be added to the classpath.

        <h2>Simple Java Program</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the
          filename.
          <br />
          Let's create our first Java file, called Main.java, which can be done in any text editor
          (like Notepad).
          <code>
            <pre>
public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}                       </pre
            >
          </code>
          Save the code in Notepad as "Main.java". Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe), navigate to the
          directory where you saved your file, and type "javac Main.java":
          <br />
          <code> C:\Users\Your Name>javac Main.java </code>
          <br /><br />
          This will compile your code. If there are no errors in the code, the command prompt will
          take you to the next line. Now, type "java Main" to run the file:
          <br />
          <code> C:\Users\Your Name>java Main </code>
          <br /><br />
          Output:
          <br />
          Hello World!
        </p>
